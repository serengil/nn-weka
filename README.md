Building Neural Networks Model with Weka

This project builds a neural network model with Weka machine learning tool.

Project code is tested on JDK 1.7 and referencing Weka 3.6 version (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html ).

=====
Usage
=====
Run WekaNN.java under the package com.ml.weka.nn.

Trainset is stored under the folder dataset. You can work on xor.txt or xor.arff files. The both produce same results. 

Alternatively, you can change or customize trainset to apply machine learning for different problems.
